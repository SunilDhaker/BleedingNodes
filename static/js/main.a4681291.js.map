But here is the thing react do not always wrap a corresponding native element but wraps a generic view/or a custom native implemented view and adds properties to it. Like xcodex<Text> xcodex or xcodex<Switch> xcodex does not actually wraps a xcodexandroid.widget.TextView/android.widget.Switch xcodex or IOS xcodexUIText/UISwitchxcodex but its kind of Wraps a generic view (xcodexandroid.viewxcodex on android xcodexUIViewxcodex on IOS).\";\n\t\n\tvar content4 = \"React also wraps some platform specific components like xcodex<ToolBarAndroid>xcodex xcodex<DrawerLayoutAndroid>xcodex for android only and xcodex<TabBarIOS>xcodex and xcodex<NavigationBarIOS>xcodex for IOS only.These component usually wraps corresponding native Component like xcodexDrawerlayout/ToolBarxcodex in android and xcodexUINavigator/UITabsxcodex in IOS.\";\n\t\n\tvar header5 = \"The Layout\";\n\tvar content5 = \"Unlike native development where we use xcodexXML xcodexon android xcodexStoryBoard xcodexon IOS react native uses xcodexflexbox xcodexfor Layout and It works amazingly well. If you know xcodexCSS xcodexyou already are master at flex-box. With flexbox you can do almost any Layout but sometime it works differently on platform for example setting xcodexborder-radius xcodexfor xcodex<InputText>xcodexdoesn't work on Android.

React app perform poorly when in debugging mode but Performance increases drastically in release mode because react has to do a lot of work to give us nice debugging exprience. Thr Performance is not as good as native app . Although it gives us 60 fps as the javascript runs in a different thread but view-intraction still stucks if javascript thread is doing a lot of work.\";\n\t\n\tvar content7 = \"If your view is very nested like with tabs/drawer/lists in a single screen than you will see a lag in app while loading view. xcodex<ListView>xcodexon react sucks it dont even recycle view that goes off screen both the native platform has very optimised implementation of xcodexListView/UITableViewxcodex. There in no wrapper available for native xcodexRecyclerView(android)xcodex or xcodexUITableView(IOS) xcodex.If your list size is as large as thousands than your app might crash if user scroll till bottom. React only renders few rows at first but as user scroll it keeps adding view to list instead recyle which results in huge memory consuption.Also react isn't fast enought to render rows as fast as as you scroll down so you will many time hit end of list and than react will render few rows the lag really kills th user exprience. Although react promises they are working on recylable implemetation of List/Table view but if you app uses complex nested view you should not consider using react not yet.\";\n\t\n\tvar content8 = \"This is graph showing memory increase as the list scroll.

The Twitter handle itself in a Twitter match. If the match is '@someTwitterUser', the handle is 'someTwitterUser'.\n\t * 4. Group that matches an email address. Used to determine if the match is an email address, as well as holding the full \n\t *    address. Ex: 'me@my.com'\n\t * 5. Group that matches a URL in the input text. Ex: 'http://google.com', 'www.google.com', or just 'google.com'.\n\t *    This also includes a path, url parameters, or hash anchors. Ex: google.com/path/to/file?q1=1&q2=2#myAnchor\n\t * 6. Group that matches a protocol URL (i.e. 'http://google.com'). This is used to match protocol URLs with just a single\n\t *    word, like 'http://localhost', where we won't double check that the domain name has at least one '.' in it.\n\t * 7.

Don\\'t worry if you don\\'t know about these technologies this was just for reference '\n\nvar content3 = \"So what  native means when you run your react native app javascript will create a native view for every element you define in jsx tag for example xcodex<TextInput>xcodex wraps a xcodexandroid.widget.EditTextxcodex on android and a xcodexUIKit.UITextField xcodex on IOS. But here is the thing react do not always wrap a corresponding native element but wraps a generic view/or a custom native implemented view and adds properties to it. Like xcodex<Text> xcodex or xcodex<Switch> xcodex does not actually wraps a xcodexandroid.widget.TextView/android.widget.Switch xcodex or IOS xcodexUIText/UISwitchxcodex but its kind of Wraps a generic view (xcodexandroid.viewxcodex on android xcodexUIViewxcodex on IOS).\"\n\nvar content4 = \"React also wraps some platform specific components like xcodex<ToolBarAndroid>xcodex xcodex<DrawerLayoutAndroid>xcodex for android only and xcodex<TabBarIOS>xcodex and xcodex<NavigationBarIOS>xcodex for IOS only.These component usually wraps corresponding native Component like xcodexDrawerlayout/ToolBarxcodex in android and xcodexUINavigator/UITabsxcodex in IOS.\"\n\nvar header5 = \"The Layout\"\nvar content5 = \"Unlike native development where we use xcodexXML xcodexon android xcodexStoryBoard xcodexon IOS react native uses xcodexflexbox xcodexfor Layout and It works amazingly well. If you know xcodexCSS xcodexyou already are master at flex-box. With flexbox you can do almost any Layout but sometime it works differently on platform for example setting xcodexborder-radius xcodexfor xcodex<InputText>xcodexdoesn't work on Android. React provide nice api for acene transition and costome animation that works well.\"\n\nvar header6 = \"Performance\"\nvar content6 = \"Javascript perform amazingly well on IOS devices but works not so good on Android devices specially old one. React app perform poorly when in debugging mode but Performance increases drastically in release mode because react has to do a lot of work to give us nice debugging exprience. Thr Performance is not as good as native app . Although it gives us 60 fps as the javascript runs in a different thread but view-intraction still stucks if javascript thread is doing a lot of work.\"\n\n\nvar content7  = \"If your view is very nested like with tabs/drawer/lists in a single screen than you will see a lag in app while loading view. xcodex<ListView>xcodexon react sucks it dont even recycle view that goes off screen both the native platform has very optimised implementation of xcodexListView/UITableViewxcodex. There in no wrapper available for native xcodexRecyclerView(android)xcodex or xcodexUITableView(IOS) xcodex.If your list size is as large as thousands than your app might crash if user scroll till bottom. React only renders few rows at first but as user scroll it keeps adding view to list instead recyle which results in huge memory consuption.Also react isn't fast enought to render rows as fast as as you scroll down so you will many time hit end of list and than react will render few rows the lag really kills th user exprience. Although react promises they are working on recylable implemetation of List/Table view but if you app uses complex nested view you should not consider using react not yet.\"\n\nvar content8 = \"This is graph showing memory increase as the list scroll. This image was posted on github comunity of react-native\"\n\n\nvar header9 = \"The joy of Developing in JavaScript\"\nvar content9 = \"#1. Developing with react native is super awesome. React-native cli now provide direct running app in IOS Simulator/Android Emulator without even touching xcode/Android Studio. React provide feature like xboldxHot Reloading , Live Reloadxboldx and xboldxChrome/IDE Debuggerxboldx which makes debuging alot easier\"\nvar content10 = \"#2. In native development even for a smallest change you have to recompile the whole project that takes a lot of time where as In react native you just press save and changes will hot reload or patch based on your development setting.\"\nvar content11 = \"#3. xboldxWireless debuggingxboldx is even more fun to work with if your mobile device and development machine are on same network than you can debug app on your mobile wirelessly just hit save and hot reload.\"\nvar content12 = \"#4. xboldxOn Scren Logxboldx and xboldxBreakPointxboldx are also cool feature of react native when ever app has issue it shows log on mobile screen itself. You can put debbuger in code to stop code exection and see all the values of objects in chrome debugger or you can also use IDE like xboldxVS Codexboldx with plugins to run and debug in ide itself.\"\n\nvar content13 = \"#5. xboldxPackage Managerxboldx is powerfull tool for react native there are thousands of implementation of react component available just hit xcodexnpm install myAwesomeLibraryxcodex and you have it. The react way is making  app is create reusable component.\"\n\n\nvar header14 = \"Conclusion\"\nvar content14 = \"React is awesome and will evolve with time. Learing and developing app is lot easier than native platform indivisually.
